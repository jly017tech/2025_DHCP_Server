  After installing DHCP server, I open DHCP server and went to right click New Scope. I name Husky Scope and wrote in description said Range addreses from 172.168.22.100 - 172.168.22.300

<h1>IP Address Range</h1>

 <p>I use the IP addresses I mention from Creating scope section and put 172.168.22.100 in Start Address and 172.168.22.300 in End.
 Lastly, I put subnet to 24 and it is equivalent as 255.255.255.0</p>
